export const aboutMeText = `Enthusiastic and resourceful web developer and multidisciplinary artist, interested in technology, the future, culture, behaviour and people. I embrace novelty with openess and I'm eager to stay out of the comfort zone by learning, with the goal of building, creating and sharing while diving deeper into programming and it's possibilities every day.

Previously working in the Fashion and Advertising industry, I decided it was time to move on and follow one of my other big interests: technology.
After using a bunch of idle time I had available to study programming by myself and later attending a Development Bootcamp at LeWagon, I gathered knowledge on some of the most often used technologies on full-stack applications such as React, TypeScript, JavaScript and Rails. By comitting to follow commonly used methodologies and conventions I was able to build consistent projects either on my own or in teams.

My approach working in teams is the same as my approach to people anywhere. For me it is important that the work enviroment is respectful, tolerant and open. I believe good communication is essential in such a place. 

Currently I am based in Berlin, Germany.
Feel free to reach me if you're  interested in getting to know me better.
