export const aboutMeText = `I am Jean Michel Battirola, a creative soul and a change embracer. I moved to Germany in September 2017. Leaving a stable position on the market in as a Beauty Artist in my home country looking for more opportunities to grow, learn and get in touch with people from different backgrounds, I chose Berlin as the starting point of this part of my journey.

Having a enormous Interest in Technology and curiosity about how people use it in their lives, I saw Web-Development as a Waypoint to learn more about Programming and Technology. My former experiences prepared me for the challenges I face daily when developing Web Applications like trouble shooting and user experience, so there's no challenge big enough for me. I intrinsically feel the necessity to learn, create, build and share and I find Programming is the perfect medium for that. Since the end of my Bootcamp experience in March 2021, using the Full-Stack knowledge I gathered so far I already developed real-life use projects of my own authorship.

Part of my daily routine is to research different topics to aggregate knowledge and improve my interpersonal and technical skills set. I am creative, proactive and I naturally think out of the box to come up with clever solutions for problems I face. I find one of the most valuable experiences is to know more about people's stories, who they are, what they do and build healthy relationships, which makes me a excellent team worker. I'm eager to learn and develop myself therefore I'm constantly practicing exertion. I like to put extra energy to deliver best possible and exceed expectations with everything I do.

I'm looking forward to dive deeper every day in Programming and Development and to learn more from experienced professionals. My priority is to have a healthy work routine so that I can be the most productive and use my time and brain energy on what really matters. On that account I'm prepared for and mostly interested in working in a Remote Setting.`
